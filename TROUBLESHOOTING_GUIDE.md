# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - Restful API Issue

## The Issue
Your test logs show requests going to `https://restful-api.dev/objects` instead of `https://api.restful-api.dev/objects`

## The Solution

### ✅ What's Already Correct:
- Environment file has the correct URL: `"value": "https://api.restful-api.dev"`
- Collection file uses variables: `{{base_url_restful}}/objects`

### 🎯 Fix Steps:

1. **In Postman, ensure you've selected the environment:**
   - Top right corner → Environment dropdown
   - Select "API Testing Environment"
   - Make sure it shows as "ACTIVE"

2. **Check environment variables are loaded:**
   - Click the "👁️ eye" icon next to environment selector
   - Verify `base_url_restful` shows: `https://api.restful-api.dev`

3. **Re-import if needed:**
   - File → Import → Select both files again
   - Choose "Replace" when prompted

4. **Test single request:**
   - Open "Health Check - Restful API" request
   - Verify URL shows: `{{base_url_restful}}/objects`
   - Click Send (should work now!)

## Current Status

### ✅ **Working APIs:**
- **Simple Books API**: Perfect! ✓
- **REST Countries API**: Perfect! ✓
- **Environment Variables**: Chaining works! ✓

### ⚠️ **Needs Environment Fix:**
- **Restful API**: Environment not applied during test

## Expected Result After Fix:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Google Pixel 6 Pro",
  "data": {
    "color": "Cloudy White",
    "capacity": "128 GB"
  }
}
```

Your Assignment 4 is **95% COMPLETE** - just need the environment properly selected! 🎯
